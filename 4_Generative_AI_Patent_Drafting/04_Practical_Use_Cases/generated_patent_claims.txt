**Structured Patent Claims:**

**Claim 1:**  
An AI-powered chatbot system for dynamically adapting to user emotions, comprising:  
a) a sentiment analysis module configured to receive and analyze user input to detect emotional cues;  
b) a contextual learning module interfaced with the sentiment analysis module, designed to adapt the chatbot's responses based on previous interactions and detected emotions;  
c) a response generation module that formulates responses in real-time, taking inputs from both the sentiment analysis module and the contextual learning module to modify tone and content according to the detected emotional state of the user; and  
d) a feedback mechanism, which gathers user responses to chatbot interactions to refine and enhance the adaptability of the sentiment analysis and contextual learning modules over time.

**Claim 2:**  
The system of claim 1, wherein the sentiment analysis module employs natural language processing algorithms to assess user inputs for emotional keywords, phrases, and context.

**Claim 3:**  
The system of claim 1, wherein the contextual learning module includes a machine learning component that updates a user profile with each interaction, thereby improving understanding of user-specific emotional patterns and preferences.

**Claim 4:**  
The system of claim 1, further comprising a database to store historical user interaction data, wherein the contextual learning module accesses this database to provide personalized interaction experiences.

**Claim 5:**  
The method for providing a dynamic and emotionally adaptive interaction between a chatbot and a user, comprising the steps of:  
a) receiving user input;  
b) analyzing the input with a sentiment analysis module to determine emotional content;  
c) accessing a contextual learning module to correlate current interaction data with previous user interactions;  
d) generating a contextually relevant response with adjusted emotional tone based on analysis; and  
e) delivering the generated response to the user.

**Claim 6:**  
The method of claim 5, further comprising the step of updating a user emotion profile with data from the interaction to improve the accuracy of future emotional assessments.

**Claim 7:**  
A computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor, causes a chatbot to perform the steps of:  
a) receiving and processing user input to identify emotional indicators;  
b) utilizing a contextual learning framework to adapt responses to the current emotional state of the user;  
c) formulating responses that reflect empathy and contextual understanding, and  
d) implementing a feedback process to refine emotional detection and response mechanisms continually.

**Claim 8:**
