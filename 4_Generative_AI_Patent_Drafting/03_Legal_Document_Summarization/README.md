# AI-POWERED LEGAL DOCUMENT SUMMARIZATION  

## OVERVIEW  
This section is all about using GPT-4o to summarize legal documents, like patents and contracts. The goal is simple: cut through the complexity, keep key details, and speed up legal analysis.  

---

## 🔹 OBJECTIVES  
✔ Summarize patents and contracts automatically.  
✔ Keep key legal details and obligations intact.  
✔ Make legal document review faster and easier.  

---

## 🔹 HOW IT WORKS  
GPT-4o processes legal text and pulls out the essentials:  
- Patent Summarization → Key claims, technical innovations, legal scope.  
- Contract Summarization → Obligations, rights, financial terms, and restrictions.

## 🔹 RUNNING THE SUMMARIZATION SCRIPTS  

### 1️⃣ SET UP ENVIRONMENT  
Make sure OpenAI’s library is installed:  
```powershell
pip install openai
```  

### 2️⃣ RUN THE SCRIPTS  
```powershell
python summarize_patents.py
python summarize_contracts.py
```

Results are saved here:

## 🔹 BEFORE & AFTER RESULTS  

### 📌 ORIGINAL PATENT TEXT  
```
This patent describes a new method for optimizing AI-generated text by using reinforcement learning. 
The system consists of a neural network model trained on a dataset of legal documents and fine-tuned 
through iterative self-improvement cycles. The invention aims to improve the consistency and accuracy 
of AI-generated patent claims.
```

### 📌 AI-GENERATED SUMMARY  
```
The patent outlines a method for enhancing AI-generated text through reinforcement learning. 
The system employs a neural network model initially trained on a dataset of legal documents. 
It undergoes fine-tuning via iterative self-improvement cycles. The primary objective of the invention 
is to enhance both the consistency and accuracy of AI-generated patent claims.

## 🔹 WHY THIS MATTERS  
✔ Faster Legal Review → AI cuts down reading time.  
✔ Better Understanding → Keeps the important details, no extra fluff.  
✔ Scalability → Can process thousands of legal documents at once.
