### 📌 README: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means (Andrew Ng-Style Application)

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their spending behavior and income.  
Inspired by Andrew Ng’s "Machine Learning Specialization", this project follows a structured ML workflow:  

✔ Data Preparation → Feature engineering, scaling, and preprocessing.  
✔ Model Training & Optimization → Selecting the best K using Elbow & Silhouette Methods.  
✔ Evaluation & Interpretation → Clustering performance and customer insights.  

The focus is on practical ML application, reinforcing core concepts covered in the Andrew Ng Specialization, particularly:  

🔹 Unsupervised Learning → K-Means clustering for real-world segmentation.  
🔹 Feature Scaling → Why and how it affects clustering performance.  
🔹 Evaluation Metrics → Using silhouette scores to assess cluster quality.  
🔹 Model Deployment → Generating structured outputs for business decisions.
