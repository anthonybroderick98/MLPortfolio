# Python Fundamentals for AI/ML  

## Overview  
This section focused on refining core Python programming skills essential for AI/ML development. The goal was to strengthen foundational programming knowledge while ensuring that the code follows best practices in structure, readability, and efficiency. Through exercises and reusable functions, this stage reinforced key Python concepts such as data types, loops, file handling, and modular programming.  

Each script in this folder was tested for correctness, optimized for clarity, and structured to facilitate easy integration into machine learning workflows.

## Review Process & Key Takeaways  
The learning process involved:  

- Writing and testing Python fundamentals through structured exercises.  
- Implementing reusable functions for data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- Ensuring all scripts executed correctly and produced expected outputs.  
- Refining code readability by adding meaningful comments and improving structure.  

The outputs from these scripts were validated to ensure that all implemented functions performed as expected.

## Folder Contents & Their Purpose  

| File Name     | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `exercises.py` | Hands-on Python exercises covering fundamental programming concepts. |
| `scripts.py` | Collection of reusable Python functions for AI/ML preprocessing tasks. |
| `sample_text.txt` | Generated file demonstrating file handling operations. |
| `processed_data.csv` | Output file created by `scripts.py`, containing processed numerical and categorical data. |

## Generated Output Files & Their Role  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `sample_text.txt` (Generated by `exercises.py`)  
This file was created to demonstrate Python‚Äôs file handling capabilities. It confirms that text can be successfully written to and read from a file using Python‚Äôs built-in `open()` function.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `processed_data.csv` (Generated by `scripts.py`)  
This file stores preprocessed data after applying missing value handling, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.  
- Missing values were handled using median or mean imputation.  
- Categorical data was encoded using label encoding for single-category columns and one-hot encoding for multi-category variables.  
- Numerical features were standardized to ensure consistent scaling for AI/ML models.  

The successful generation of this file confirms that data transformation steps were applied correctly.
