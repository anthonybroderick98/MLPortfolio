### 📌 README: Debugging & Optimization in AI/ML Pipelines  

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on debugging errors, optimizing performance, and writing reusable AI/ML scripts.  
By applying structured debugging, logging, and modular functions, we ensure AI/ML pipelines are:  
✔ More efficient → Faster execution & optimized code.  
✔ More reliable → Debugging logs track and fix issues.  
✔ More reusable → Modular code allows easy modifications.

## 📌 Step-by-Step Debugging Process  

### 1️⃣ Handling Missing Values (`debugging_examples.py`)  
✔ Problem: Dataset contained NaN (missing values), causing calculation errors.  
✔ Fix:  
- If >40% missing, dropped the column.  
- Otherwise, filled NaNs using median imputation.  

📂 Key Outputs:  
| File | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `outputs/debugged_missing_values.csv` | Dataset after handling missing values. |

---

### 2️⃣ Fixing Data Type Errors (`debugging_examples.py`)  
✔ Problem: The `Salary` column was mistakenly converted to string, causing calculation failures.  
✔ Fix:  
- Used `pd.to_numeric(df["Salary"], errors="coerce")` to safely convert back to numbers.  
- Applied data validation before operations.  

📂 Key Outputs:  
| File | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `outputs/debugged_data_types.csv` | Dataset after fixing data type errors. |

---

### 3️⃣ Debugging Model Training Issues (`debugging_examples.py`)  
✔ Problem: Logistic Regression failed to train due to inconsistent input data.  
✔ Fix:  
- Standardized the feature format.  
- Ensured correct array structures.  

📌 Model Training Output:  
```
✅ Model trained successfully. Accuracy: 1.0000
```

---

### 4️⃣ Fixing Data Splitting Issues (`debugging_examples.py`)  
✔ Problem: `train_test_split()` failed due to insufficient data.  
✔ Fix:  
- If dataset <5 rows, dynamically adjusted `test_size` to prevent errors.  

📂 Key Outputs:  
| Message | Outcome |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `✅ Data split successfully. Train: 2, Test: 1` | Data split was corrected dynamically. |

## 📌 Writing Reusable AI/ML Code (`writing_reusable_code.py`)  

### 🔹 Why Write Reusable Code?  
✔ Improves Code Maintainability → Functions make the code modular and easier to manage.  
✔ Enhances Debugging & Logging → Logs help track errors and execution flow.  
✔ Boosts Scalability → Code can handle different datasets and be extended easily.  

📌 Techniques Used:  
✔ Logging → Replaced print statements with structured logs in `logging_report.txt`.  
✔ Modular Functions → Wrapped key AI/ML operations into functions for reuse.  
✔ Output File Handling → Ensured data and logs are saved properly.

### 5️⃣ Feature Scaling (`writing_reusable_code.py`)  
✔ Problem: Different feature scales affected clustering performance.  
✔ Fix:  
- Used `StandardScaler()` to normalize numerical features.  

📂 Key Outputs:  
| File | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `outputs/final_processed_data.csv` | Scaled dataset before clustering. |

---

### 6️⃣ Running K-Means Clustering (`writing_reusable_code.py`)  
✔ Problem: Customers weren’t grouped optimally due to unscaled data.  
✔ Fix:  
- Applied K-Means clustering with `k=3`.  

📂 Key Outputs:  
| File | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `outputs/kmeans_clusters.png` | Cluster visualization. |
