# AI in Legal Research

## Overview  
This section explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing legal research, patent searches, and prior art analysis.

AI tools can:
- Speed up legal document analysis by extracting key information from complex legal texts, such as patent claims and legal arguments.
- Enhance patent searches by comparing new inventions with existing patents and prior art, helping legal professionals identify relevant references and avoid duplication.
- Automate legal summarization for faster decision-making, generating AI-driven insights that assist attorneys in evaluating the novelty and relevance of patent applications and legal claims.

In this section, we applied AI to analyze a patent document, extracting key insights on its novelty, potential claims, and applications in the legal domain.

## üìå What You‚Äôll Learn  
‚úÖ How AI assists in legal research and patent analysis, especially in the context of reinforcement learning and legal datasets.  
‚úÖ Writing AI-powered code to analyze legal documents and patent claims.  
‚úÖ Testing AI-generated summaries and legal insights, particularly in analyzing novelty and inventive step for patent applications.

In our example, we used reinforcement learning techniques and a neural network trained on legal datasets to generate AI-powered patent insights, specifically focused on the potential claims and technical challenges of a sample patent.
