## 📌 How It Works  
The script `analyze_patent.py` performs the following steps:

### 1️⃣ **Retrieve API Key**  
The OpenAI API key is securely retrieved from the environment variable.

### 2️⃣ **Initialize OpenAI Client**  
The OpenAI client is initialized with the provided API key, allowing interaction with the GPT-4 model to generate patent landscape insights.

### 3️⃣ **Analyze Patent Data**  
The script analyzes patent data related to AI-driven medical diagnosis, neural network optimization, and real-time speech recognition. It then generates insights about the key companies and trends shaping these sectors, such as **OpenAI**, **DeepMind**, and **IBM**.

### 4️⃣ **Output Results**  
The analysis results are saved in the `ai_patent_landscape_analysis_output.txt` file, which includes a detailed summary of the patent landscape and key findings. This file serves as an AI-generated report, providing valuable insights into the current state of AI-related patent innovation.

## 📌 Running the Script  
1. **Set the OpenAI API Key**:  
   You need to set your OpenAI API key before running the script. In PowerShell or Command Prompt, run:

   ```bash
   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"  # PowerShell
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here     # Command Prompt
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:  
   Navigate to the folder containing the script and run:

   ```bash
   python analyze_patent.py
   ```

3. **Check the Output**:  
   After the script runs successfully, it will generate the **`ai_patent_landscape_analysis_output.txt`** file containing the analysis results in the same folder.
