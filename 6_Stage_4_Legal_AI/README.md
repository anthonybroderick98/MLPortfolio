
# Stage 4: Legal AI

## Overview

This stage explores the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Intellectual Property (IP) Law through legal research, patent analysis, and case studies. The objective is to apply AI techniques in legal contexts, analyze key industry trends, and evaluate real-world applications of AI in IP law. This project aligns with my passion for AI/ML and demonstrates how AI expertise intersects with intellectual property, which is a key focus area for the Mewburn Ellis AI, Machine Learning & Informatics Summer Internship.

This project is divided into four core sections:

1. IP Law Basics – Foundational legal principles related to Intellectual Property.
2. AI in Legal Research – Using AI for patent research and legal document analysis.
3. Patent Landscape Analysis – Evaluating industry trends and major players in AI patents.
4. Case Studies – Reviewing real-world examples of AI’s impact on Intellectual Property Law.

## 1️⃣ IP Law Basics

### Objective
This section introduces Intellectual Property (IP) Law, covering patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. The focus is on legal definitions, ownership, and AI’s role in shaping future IP regulations. 

### Key Topics Covered:
- The fundamentals of IP Law and how AI-generated content challenges existing legal frameworks.
- Legal definitions and classifications of patents, copyrights, and trademarks.
- Open legal questions on whether AI can be listed as an inventor in patents.

### Next Steps for Improvement:
- Expand the legal case references to include ongoing debates on AI-generated patents in the US, EU, and China.
- Provide real-world case examples that illustrate how AI interacts with copyright and trademark law.
