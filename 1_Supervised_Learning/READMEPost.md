# Supervised Learning: Titanic Survival Prediction  

## Overview  
This project explores supervised learning techniques to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster based on historical passenger data.  

Using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, I developed a classification system that identifies survival patterns based on factors such as age, ticket class, and fare. By following a structured data science workflow, I ensured that the dataset was properly cleaned, models were trained and evaluated effectively, and results were clearly interpretable.  

The final model achieved up to 90% accuracy, with Random Forest emerging as the strongest performer. Beyond accuracy, the project also focuses on feature importance and explainability, ensuring that predictions are not only accurate but also interpretable.

## Approach & Methodology  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration & Preprocessing  
The foundation of any machine learning model lies in high-quality data preparation. Before training the models, I analyzed the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and challenges, including missing values and categorical features.  

Key preprocessing steps:  
‚úî Handled missing values:  
   - Used median imputation for `Age`.  
   - Applied mode imputation for `Embarked`.  
   - Dropped `Cabin` due to excessive missing values.  

‚úî Feature engineering improvements:  
   - Created FamilySize (`SibSp + Parch + 1`) to capture group travel impact.  
   - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`).  

This ensured a clean dataset, improving model performance and interpretability.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development & Training  
To build a robust classification system, I trained and compared three key supervised learning models:  

‚úî Logistic Regression ‚Äì A strong baseline model for binary classification.  
‚úî Decision Tree Classifier ‚Äì Provides interpretability by mapping decision paths.  
‚úî Random Forest Classifier ‚Äì An ensemble method that balances accuracy and feature importance.  

The dataset was split into 80% training / 20% testing, and each model was trained using Scikit-learn. Hyperparameters were adjusted to optimize performance, ensuring a fair comparison across classifiers.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation & Insights  
A key focus of this project was assessing model performance using multiple evaluation metrics:  

‚úî Classification Metrics:  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.  
   - ROC-AUC score to measure sensitivity and specificity.  

‚úî Visual Analysis:  
   - Confusion matrices to understand correct vs. incorrect classifications.  
   - ROC curves to compare model performance across different thresholds.  
   - Feature importance plots to highlight which attributes influenced survival.  

The results demonstrated that Random Forest outperformed other models, achieving up to 90% accuracy. However, Logistic Regression provided better interpretability, making it easier to explain predictions.

‚úî Fine-tune model hyperparameters using Grid Search to improve performance.  
‚úî Experiment with advanced classifiers such as Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Machines.  
‚úî Expand feature engineering by exploring interaction terms and scaling techniques.  

This project can also be extended beyond Titanic survival prediction to real-world applications, such as:  
‚úî Customer Churn Prediction ‚Äì Identifying customers at risk of leaving a service.  
‚úî Fraud Detection ‚Äì Analyzing financial transactions for anomalies.  
‚úî Medical Diagnosis ‚Äì Predicting disease outcomes based on patient history.

## Final Thoughts  

This project demonstrates the power of supervised learning in making data-driven predictions. By following a structured pipeline‚Äîfrom data cleaning to model evaluation‚ÄîI built a classification system that is both accurate and interpretable.  

Beyond the Titanic dataset, these methods are widely applicable, showcasing how machine learning can be leveraged to solve real-world classification problems.
