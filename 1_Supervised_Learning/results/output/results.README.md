## 📂 Results Directory Breakdown  

### 1️⃣ `titanic_predictions.csv` – Model Predictions  
This file contains the survival predictions made by different models, structured as follows:  

✔ PassengerIndex → Index of the passenger in the test dataset  
✔ ActualSurvived → True survival status (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)  
✔ PredictedSurvived → Model-predicted survival status (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)  
✔ ProbabilitySurvived → Probability score of survival (if available)  
✔ Model → Model used for the prediction (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  

This file allows for direct comparison between actual outcomes and model predictions, making it easier to evaluate performance and misclassifications.

### 2️⃣ `plots/` – Model Performance Visualizations  
This subdirectory contains key visualizations that assess classifier effectiveness, including:  

✔ Confusion Matrices → Breakdown of correct vs. incorrect classifications (True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, False Negatives)  
✔ ROC Curves → True Positive Rate vs. False Positive Rate, visualizing model sensitivity & specificity  
✔ Precision-Recall Curves → Trade-off between precision and recall, useful for class imbalance analysis  
✔ Feature Importance Plots → For tree-based models, these highlight which features contributed most to survival predictions  

These visualizations help interpret model decisions, assess performance, and refine future iterations.
